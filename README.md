## Activity 01 - Data Features

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the creation of a simple data feature prototype that helps users find restaurants offering food similar to their cravings.

## Features

- Searches for a similar food item to a user input through the Spoonacular API
- Searches for a restaurant offering any food using the Google Places API (No need for OAuth)
- Displays up to 5 stores in New York State that have food similar to user input

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need to set up API keys for:

1. Spoonacular API (for food searches)
2. Google Places API (for restaurant search)

## Usage

1. Run the notebook cells in order.
2. When prompted, enter a food you are craving (e.g., Lo Mein or Fried Rice).
3. When prompted, enter the number of the different food recommendations that Spoonacular gives you.
4. The notebook will display up to 5 stores offering the new food of your choosing.

## Note

This is a prototype for educational purposes. In a real-world application, additional features such as a user interface, ability to add/remove tickers, financial metrics, and robust error handling would be implemented.
